### <a id="description"></a> <span class="aloha">Course Description</span>

Seminar class in which we read, critique and discuss recent research papers with an emphasis on:Â (i) cutting-edge Machine Learning/Deep Learning and Natural Language Processing methods that have been (or could be) applied to social media data; and (ii) applications of social media analysis for social good, i.e. tackling meaningful real-world problems (e.g. in health and the social sciences).

Students will take turns presenting a paper each week, which we will discuss together critically during class meetings. The leader/presenter each week will be responsible for presenting the paper(s) to the class.Â This includes presenting relevant background material; this is important because in general we will have a strong bias toward reading very recent work in the class. Critical discussion will follow, and we will conclude class by talking about potential means of extending the work. Students will also be responsible for writing short summaries of the research papers we read each week Critical discussion will follow, and we will conclude class by talking about potential means of extending the work. -->

<!-- ##### Prerequisites

Students should have an interest in conducting (or learning how to conduct) research. There are no official pre-reqs for this class,Â Â students are expected to have some background in machine learning and statistical natural language processing. This is mainly to make students life easier since we will not cover background knowledge related to the papers in class.


### <a id="assignments"><span class="aloha">Assignments</span></a> 

##### Oral Presentations
Students will rotate responsibility for presenting (one of the) assigned papers and leading the ensuing discussion. The presentation should provide necessary background, the core contribution of the paper, (perceived) strengths and weaknesses, and ideas for improving the work. 

##### Written Critiques
Additionally, prior to every class (for which there are papers listed), all students are to write brief summaries ("reviews") of one of the assigned papers for that class (their choice). These should include a concise summary of the work and enumerate at least two strong points and at least two weak points therein. Assessments are to be posted on the blackboard discussion forum. Note that is assumed students read all assigned papers, but may read only one in-depth. Furthermore, these critiques will note ways in which the work could potentially be extended/improved (which may be coupled with the weak points). The idea is basically to ensure robust discussion during class period. 

##### Project

The class will culminate in projects and accompanying papers. These will be structured as research papers (with accompanying code, when possible). Students will write up papers following the Machine Learning for Healthcare template, available here. Students may work together if they like, but then I expect a concomitant increase in complexity and a clear delineation of contributions, for fairness sake.

Projects may involve replicating a state-of-the-art paper we read, or, ideally, extending one of these or developing new ideas in the area. Some class time will be reserved for students to present their project ideas, results and findings (these will be structured as research talks). Therefore, this class will very much be research-oriented.

##### Grades  

* 60%	Project and write-up
* 20%	In class presentations of papers
* 10%	Written summaries/critiques of papers (on blackboard)
* 10%	Participation
